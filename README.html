First off - we have to get a few things out in the open…<BR>
<BR>
From past experience with PSC, I have learned to include this little rant on PSC etiquette<BR>
(please forgive me)<BR>
<BR>
<B>1.</B> All you people out there that say "I did this when I was 3 years old" - well I spent 2 hours looking for it on PSC and the closest thing I found used Direct X which is not an option for the project I am working on. So prove it but uploading your code.<BR>
<BR>
<B>2.</B> I did not write the MCI Command module, an author by the name of "Ahadal" did - if I got the name wrong then please forgive me. Anyways if you use the module, give him his due credit.<BR>
<BR>
<B>3.</B> Everyone is a newbie once in their life, so if you are a newbie, read and follow directions before you jump to conclusions and rant and rave that this does not work. <BR>
<BR>
<B>4.</B> If you found this useful or slightly amusing them VOTE. I cannot tell you how many times I have uploaded code and everyone left a message saying it rocked, but them I get 2 votes out of 2000 people. Sorry about this one, but it is a pet peeve, and all you other authors out there know that feeling, when you upload and get crap for votes.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Instructions…</B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Step One</B><BR>
Compile the <A HREF="SNDPlayer.vbp" OnmouseOver="window.status='SNDPlayer.vbp'; return true" OnMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true"><B>SNDPlayer.vbp</B></A> project. This will create the OCX file.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Step two</B><BR>
Load the <A HREF="Project1.vbp" OnmouseOver="window.status='Project1.vbp'; return true" OnMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true"><B>Project1.vbp</B></A> project - this is the demo. If you do not do step one then VB will bark at you, some nonsense about a missing file :)<BR>
<BR>
<B>Step Three</B><BR>
Run the demo and enter filenames in the text boxes. The first one will "Play" the file you enter. The second one will "LOOP" the file you enter.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Notes</B><BR>
<BR>
You can play multiple sounds at once. I have no idea what the limit is - MS Windows will more then likely let you know when you reach it.<BR>
<BR>
For some reason the LOOP command causes a "pause" or "lag" on some computers. So far the only fix I have found for this is re-booting the computer, then it works fine. <BR>

<BR>
PS - search PSC under "cairns" for more projects I have uploaded. Most of my old work has been removed (by choice) so let me know what you think.<BR>
